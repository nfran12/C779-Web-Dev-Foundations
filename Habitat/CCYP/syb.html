<title>Habitat for Humanity International Summer Youth Blitz Program</title>
</head>

<body>

Join a Summer Build for Teenagers.
<p>
The Summer Youth Blitz is a unique service experience for a diverse group of youth, <br/>ages 16 to 18, from high schools and youth organizations around the United States. <br/> During this program, 15 to 20 youth participants and adult leaders <br/>"blitz build" an entire Habitat house in two weeks.
</p>
<p>
The house build, an unfamiliar activity for most, provides a common, <br/>nonthreatening ground for building relationships and teams.
</p>
<p>
In the evenings, the youth participate in activities like team-building games, <br/>leadership development, local cultural events or community dinners.
</p>
<p>
This program is sponsored by national grant donations and coordinated by the Campus Chapters<br/> and Youth Programs department of Habitat for Humanity International. For the past several years, <br/>funding has allowed for three blitz builds per summer--two in the United States and one outside <br/>the country. The builds take place during the months of June, July and August.
</p>
<p>
If you're interested in participating, and are between the ages of 16 and 18 years old, <br/>you must submit an application, which is available during January and February.
